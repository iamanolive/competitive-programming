* problem C in AtCoder Beginner Contest 329
* solved not as part of contest, but for practice
* rating of 300 on AtCoder

## Solution Notes

* use a pair datatype to store the max number of times a single alphabet occurs in a row
* although i could also use an array for this, initialized from 0 to 25 in the beginning of the program

- each substring has only one type of character (which can be repeated multiple times)

* ssskkyskkkky
* s == {1, 2, 3}
* k == {1, 2, 3, 4}
* y == {1}
* total = 8
