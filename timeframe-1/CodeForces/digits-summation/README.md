# F. Digits Summation

* Problem F from TLE Eliminators Level 1 (Sheet #1)
* given two integer variables, we need to print the sum of their last digits.
* the last digits of both integers are also the remainder when they are divided by 10. to find the remainder, we use the modulo operator.
* both the variables are declared to be of type long long because the max value they are said to contain is 1e18, which is too large for an int datatype.
