# G. Summation from 1 to N

* Problem G from TLE Eliminators Level 1 (Sheet #1)
* the problem simply asks us to print the sum of all numbers from 1 to n (both inclusive). we can use the formula for counting the sum of all numbers in a given range, which is (n * (n + 1)) / 2.
* (the method of using a for loop to iterate over all the numbers in the range and storing their sum in a variable yields a time limit exceeded error)
