## Notes while Solving

* minutes taken to solve each problem == position it appears at in the alphabets
* sort the string using the sort() function and create an array that stores the number of times each letter in the alphabet occurs in the string, at the array index matching the order of the letter. (count of A gets stored at index 1 etc)
* iterate through the array and keep a counter variable that increments by one each time the element at a given array index is greater than or equal to its index.
