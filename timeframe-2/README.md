# Current Strategy

* for every rating, start with c2 ladders. if those problems are too difficult, do codeforces problems of that rating until you know the answer to 10 problems in a row
* practice one TIMED atcoder contest a day (preferably in the mornings) and spend all the time you have after dinner understanding solutions and faster implementation methods.
* we're ignoring codechef completely for now
* do all the usaco bronze classes in the second week of march. ignore everything for that one week (except actual atcoder and codeforces contests) and solve more problems than is humanly possible.


## Codeforces problem solving

* read editorials for ALL problems. even if you were able to solve them completely.
* break larger problems (900 rated and greater) into smaller ones and always keep paper handy (PAPER IS NOT FOR DOODLING)
* don't submit problems (contest or in practice sessions) if you aren't a hundred percent certain of the answer and couldn't explain the technique used to a human being without feeling like a probable idiot.


## week 001

* start with completing all TLE level 1 and level 2 lectures and all the practice problems that come with it. search for solutions that you can't understand online and also ask in forums. and answer like every question that you can.
* brute force and greedy algorithm until you understand them completely and could solve absolutely any problem in either.
* all 800 rated problems on c2oj and all the others you might need to solve before meeting above-mentioned condition.
* also the same as above for all 900 rated ones.

## week 002

* bronze section of the usaco guide and also the bronze self-study classes available on the website.
* practice past contests after you finish with all the classes and maybe also look into the first problems of silver contests.
* DO NOT half-ass any of the problmes. don't submit if you don't think your answer isn't right (esp if you have some faulty logic you're trying to convince the world works)

## week 003

*
