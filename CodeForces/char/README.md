# N. Char

* Problem N from TLE Eliminators Level 1 (Sheet #1)
* the question states that the different between a letter in lowercase and the same letter in uppercase is 32.
* use the isupper and islower functions to check the case of the entered character.
* if the character is in lowercase, subtract 32 from it to convert it to uppercase.
* if the character is in uppercase, add 32 to it to convert to lowercase.
* cast the characters back to type char before printing to ensure that our functions don't print the ASCII values of characters instead.
