# Q. Coordinates of a Point

* Problem Q from TLE Eliminators Level 1 (Sheet #1)
* Based entirely on coordinate geometry
* if both the x and y coordinates are 0, the point lies on the origin
* if only x is 0, the point lies somewhere on the Y-axis. if only y is 0, it lies somewhere on the X-axis.
* if x is greater than 0 and y is greater than 0, it lies in Q1. if only x is greater than 0, it lies in Q4
* if x is less than 0 and y is also less than 0, it lies in Q3. if x is less than and y is greater than 0, the point lies Q2.
