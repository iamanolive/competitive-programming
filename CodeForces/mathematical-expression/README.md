# W. Mathematical Expression

* Problem W from TLE Eliminators Level 1 (Sheet #1)
* The maximum the result can amount to is 1e5 and the minimum is 1e-5, so we can use an int to store all the integer variables and chars for the signs.
* Use a switch statement to check whether the mathematical expression is correct for the given operator.
* If it is, print "Yes", otherwise print the right answer when the operator acts on variables a and b.
