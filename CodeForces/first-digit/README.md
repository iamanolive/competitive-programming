# P. First digit

* Problem P from TLE Eliminators Level 1 (Sheet #1)
* take in the number as a string, and convert the first character of the string to a number (this can be done by casting the character into an int and subtracting the value of char(0) from it)
* if the integer obtained yields 0 as a remainder when divided by 2 (the remainder of a number is gotten by using the modulo symbol), output EVEN. otherwise, output ODD.
