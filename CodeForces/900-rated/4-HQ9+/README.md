* codeforces beta round 96 (div 2)
* problem link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/133/A
* submission 1: wrong answer on test 3 (declared that '+' would also produce an output because was confused if by output they meant text being printed, or an action taking place)
* submission 2: accepted (removed the '+' results in YES statement and everything works fine now)
* 

## Problem Recap

* "H" = "Hello, World!",
* "Q" = source code of program
* "9" = lyrics of "99 Bottles of Beer" song
* "+" = increments value stored in internal accumulator

* H and Q must be uppercase
* if character input != any of the instructions, IGNORE
* given program, output if execution will produce an output
