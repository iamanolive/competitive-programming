# 20. Construct the String

* codeforces round 634 (div 3)
* problem link:
* submission 1: ACCEPTED!!!!! (getting a string question accepted and that too on the first try is the greatest accomplishment OF MY LIFE. I DID IT. I'M A SUCCESS)

## Solution Notes

* 1 <= B <= A <= N <= 2000
* if B == 1, print N occurrences of whatever alphabet (let's say 'a')
* if A == B, print the first A letters of the alphabet, and keep printing from the first one over and over again until N is reached
* if A > B, 

* a = 5, b = 3 { abcabcab }
* a = 8, b = 5 { abcdeabc }


* A cannot be less than B, so all conditions are satisfied
