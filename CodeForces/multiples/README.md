# J. Multiples

* Problem J from TLE Eliminators Level 1 (Sheet #1)
* to check if a number 'x' is a multiple of another number 'y' and vice-versa, when we divide the numbers by each other, their remainder should be 0.
* we use the modulo operator to check for remainder. so our conditon will be that either (a % b) should equal 0 OR (b % a) should equal 0.
