# K. Max and Min

* Problem K from TLE Eliminators Level 1 (Sheet #1)
* instead of checking for multiple conditions, we can take in all the three integers as an array of size three, and use the sort funtion (from the algorithm header) to sort the input array.
* the first element of the array will be the minimum of the three numbers, and the last element will be the maximum.
